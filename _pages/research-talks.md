WebGraph: Capturing Advertising and Tracking Information Flows for Robust Blocking  
[[Zoom Registration](https://ucl.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJYpf-2grTorGNxFnItdfR3SSG89tgyB9Zeh)] [[Live Stream]()]<details>**Abstract:** Users rely on ad and tracker blocking tools to protect their privacy. Unfortunately, existing ad and tracker blocking tools are susceptible to mutable advertising and tracking content. In this paper, we first demonstrate that a state-of-the-art ad and tracker blocker, AdGraph, is susceptible to such adversarial evasion techniques that are currently deployed on the web. Second, we introduce WebGraph, the first ML-based ad and tracker blocker that detects ads and trackers based on their action rather than their content. By featurizing the actions that are fundamental to advertising and tracking information flows – e.g., storing an identifier in the browser or sharing an identifier with another tracker – WebGraph performs nearly as well as prior approaches, but is significantly more robust to adversarial evasions. In particular, we show that WebGraph achieves comparable accuracy to AdGraph, while significantly decreasing the success rate of an adversary from near-perfect for AdGraph to around 8% for WebGraph. Finally, we show that WebGraph remains robust to sophisticated adversaries that use adversarial evasion techniques beyond those currently deployed on the web.  
<br>**Bio**: Sandra is a PhD candidate in the Security and Privacy Engineering (SPRING) lab at EPFL. Her research interests are mainly in the areas of network security, web security, and privacy. The overarching theme of her research is to understand what we can learn from analysing meta-data, in the context of security and privacy. She applies this analysis to two use-cases: improving resistance of networking protocols to traffic analysis, and developing automated tracking detection on websites.<br></details>
