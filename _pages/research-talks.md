**Daniel Woods, Innsbruck University**  
Measuring and managing cyber risk <details>**Abstract:** Improving cybersecurity across society requires more than just designing secure systems, we must also understand the evidence base and incentive structure that leads firms to adopt secure solutions. This talk begins with a systematisation of 30 years of quantitative cyber risk research.  I then present an approach to estimating the risk and size of cyber losses that involves reverse engineering insurance prices.  I also present ongoing work trying to quantify software security via 0-day exploit prices.  The second part of the talk presents evidence about how insurers and lawyers are fundamentally changing how firms respond to cyber incidents.

I’d prefer not to say: Investigating the effects of
information control mechanisms in different online social
environments<details>**Abstract:** When signing up to social networking sites, completing online profiles, or after sending messages to friends on WhatsApp, people may choose to withhold certain information about themselves or even delete information previously disclosed. Whilst providing users with control over their personal information is clearly important, little is known about the impact these control mechanisms have on users. In this talk, we will explore work conducted as part of my PhD which investigated the effect of HIV status non-disclosures in dating apps used by gay and bisexual men. This work highlights the potential negative effect non-disclosures can have on user desirability, and how this differs depending on other disclosed characteristics of the user. I will then share findings from a study I recently conducted on message deletion in mobile messaging apps, and highlight similarities in the findings across these two very different online environments

**Martin Kleppman, Cambridge University**  
Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability of Collaboration Software <details>**Abstract:** Signal, WhatsApp, and other secure messaging apps have brought end-to-end encryption to billions of users. Unfortunately, many other applications still lack end-to-end security guarantees: in particular, with real-time collaboration software such as Google Docs, Overleaf, Figma, or Trello, we still have to blindly trust cloud services to process the users’ unencrypted data. This is particularly problematic for use cases such as journalistic investigations, medical records, or sensitive negotiations. This talk introduces our group's research on improving the security characteristics of collaboration software, while retaining the convenience of real-time collaboration. To improve confidentiality, we are applying end-to-end encryption, and using anonymity protocols to provide metadata privacy. To improve integrity, we aim to cryptographically verify that collaborators have consistent views of the shared document. To improve availability, our “local-first” approach ensures that even if the cloud service shuts down or suspends user accounts, users do not lose any data. Our approach is both principled and practical. We are using a wide variety of techniques, including cryptographic protocol design, formal verification of algorithms, carefully optimised data structures, and open source application prototypes, with the goal of making secure collaboration software a practical reality.

How Dark is the Forest? On Blockchain Extractable Value and High-Frequency Trading in Decentralized Finance <details><br>**Abstract:** Permissionless blockchains such as Bitcoin have excelled at financial services. Yet, opportunistic traders extract monetary value from the mesh of decentralized finance (DeFi) smart contracts through so-called blockchain extractable value (BEV). The recent emergence of centralized BEV relayer portrays BEV as a positive additional revenue source. Because BEV, however, was quantitatively shown to deteriorate the blockchain’s consensus security, BEV relayers endanger the ledger security by incentivizing rational miners to fork the chain. For example, a rational miner with a 10% hashrate will fork Ethereum if a BEV opportunity exceeds 4× the block reward.
In this talk, we quantify the BEV danger by deriving the USD extracted from sandwich attacks, liquidations, and decentralized exchange arbitrage. We estimate that over 32 months, BEV yielded 540.54M USD in profit, divided among 11,289 addresses when capturing 49,691 cryptocurrencies and 60,830 on-chain markets. The highest BEV instance we find amounts to 4.1M USD, 616.6× the Ethereum block reward. Moreover, while the practitioner’s community has discussed the existence of generalized trading bots, we are, to our knowledge, the first to provide a concrete algorithm. Our algorithm can replace unconfirmed transactions without the need to understand the victim transactions’ underlying logic, which we estimate to have yielded a profit of 57,037.32 ETH (35.37M USD) over 32 months of past blockchain data.

**Matthew Mirman, ETH Zurich**  
Trustworthy Deep Learning: Methods, Systems and Theory <details>**Abstract:** Deep learning models are quickly becoming an integral part of a plethora of high stakes applications, including autonomous driving and health care.  As the discovery of vulnerabilities and flaws in these models has become frequent, so has the interest in ensuring their safety, robustness and reliability.  My research addresses this need by introducing new core methods and systems that can establish desirable mathematical guarantees of deep learning models. In the first part of my talk I will describe how we leverage abstract interpretation to scale verification to orders of magnitude larger deep neural networks than prior work, at the same time demonstrating the correctness of significantly more properties.  I will then show how these techniques can be extended to ensure, for the first time, formal guarantees of probabilistic semantic specifications using generative models. In the second part, I will show how to fuse abstract interpretation with the training phase so as to improve a model’s amenability to certification, allowing us to guarantee orders of magnitude more properties than possible with prior work.  Finally, I will discuss exciting theoretical advances which address fundamental questions on the very existence of certified deep learning.

**Yixin Zou, University of Michigan**  
Improving People's Adoption of Security and Privacy Behaviors <details>**Abstract:** Experts recommend a plethora of advice for staying safe online, yet people still use weak passwords, fall for scams, or ignore software updates. Such inconsistent adoption of protective behaviors is understandable given the need to navigate other priorities and constraints in everyday life. Yet when the actions taken are insufficient to mitigate potential risks, it leaves people – especially those already marginalized – vulnerable to dire consequences from financial loss to abuse and harassment. In this talk, I share findings from my research on hurdles that prevent people from adopting secure behaviors and solutions that encourage adoption in three domains: designing data breach notifications, informing privacy interface guidelines in regulations, and supporting survivors of tech-enabled abuse. (1) Even small changes in system design can make a big difference. I empirically show consumers’ low awareness of data breaches, rational justifications and biases behind inaction, and how to motivate consumers to change breached passwords through nudges in breach notifications. (2) Public policy is essential in incentivizing companies to implement better data practices, but policymaking needs to be informed by evidence from research. I present a series of user studies that led to a user-tested icon for conveying the “do not sell my personal information” opt-out, now part of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). (3) Different user groups have different threat models and safety needs, requiring special considerations in developing and deploying interventions. Drawing on findings from focus groups, I discuss how computer security support agents can help survivors of tech-enabled abuse using a trauma-informed approach. Altogether, I highlight the impact of my research on technology design, public policy, and educational efforts. I end the talk by discussing how my interdisciplinary, human-centered approach in solving security and privacy challenges can apply to future work such as improving expert advice and developing trauma-informed computing systems.
