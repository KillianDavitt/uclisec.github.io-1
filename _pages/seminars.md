Multi-modal Fact-checking: Out-of-Context Images and How to Catch Them  
[[Zoom Registration](https://ucl.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJYpf-2grTorGNxFnItdfR3SSG89tgyB9Zeh)] [[Live Stream](https://youtu.be/JKwRA-PM4xI)]<details>**Abstract:** Misinformation is now a major problem due to its potential high risks to our core democratic and societal values and orders. Out-of-context misinformation is one of the easiest and most effective ways used by adversaries to spread viral false stories. In this threat, a real image is re-purposed to support other narratives by misrepresenting its context and/or elements. This talk will present our recent work to establish the first benchmark for multi-modal fact-checking. The internet is being used as the go-to way to verify information using different sources and modalities. Our goal is an inspectable method that automates this time-consuming and reasoning-intensive process by fact-checking the image-caption pairing using Web evidence. We leverage evidence using Web search via one modality, and perform a cycle consistency check to reason against the other modality. We propose a novel detection model to mimic the human fact-checking across the same and different modalities. Our results show that our framework is on a par with the average human performance, and significantly outperforms baselines that do not consider external evidence.<br><br>**Bio**: Sahar Abdelnabi is a PhD candidate at CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security, advised by Prof. Dr. Mario Fritz. She performs interdisciplinary research in the broad intersection of natural language processing, computer vision, and machine learning with security. This includes studying the vulnerabilities, limitations, and malicious use of ML models and how to defend against them (e.g., deepfakes, watermarking, and models attribution), in addition to leveraging ML to develop solutions for technical problems with significant social impacts (e.g., misinformation, phishing).<br></details>

Disparate Vulnerability to Membership Inference Attacks  
[[Recording](https://youtu.be/qf-L99WYZwc)]<details>**Abstract:** A membership inference attack (MIA) against a machine-learning model enables an attacker to determine whether a given data record was part of the model's training data or not. This talk will present an in-depth theoretical and empirical study of the phenomenon of disparate vulnerability against MIAs: unequal success rate of MIAs against different population subgroups. On the theoretical side, I will present necessary and sufficient conditions for preventing MIAs, both on average and for population subgroups, using a new notion of distributional generalization. I will also show the connections of disparate vulnerability to algorithmic fairness and to differential privacy. On the practical side, I will show that estimating disparate vulnerability to MIAs by naïvely applying existing attacks can lead to overestimation. I will show which attacks are suitable for estimating disparate vulnerability and provide a statistical framework for doing so reliably. I will present experiments finding statistically significant evidence of disparate vulnerability in realistic settings. More details are in the paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00389](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00389). This is a joint work with Mohammad Yaghini (University of Toronto), Giovanni Cherubin (Alan Turing Institute), Michael Veale (University College London), and Carmela Troncoso (EPFL).<br><br>**Bio**: Bogdan Kulynych is a PhD student at EPFL SPRING Lab.

Systematic Analysis of Programming Languages and Their Execution Environments for Spectre Attacks [[Recording](https://youtu.be/vvluE5JOFds)]<details>**Abstract:** In this paper, we analyze the security of programming languages and their execution environments (compilers and interpreters) with respect to Spectre attacks. The analysis shows that only 16 out of 42 execution environments have mitigations against at least one Spectre variant, i.e., 26 have no mitigations against any Spectre variant. Using our novel tool Speconnector, we develop Spectre proof-of-concept attacks in 8 programming languages and on code generated by 11 execution environments that were previously not known to be affected. Our results highlight some programming languages that are used to implement security-critical code, but remain entirely unprotected, even three years after the discovery of Spectre.

WebGraph: Capturing Advertising and Tracking Information Flows for Robust Blocking  
[[Recording](https://youtu.be/uRHyiEIJXM4)]<details>**Abstract:** Users rely on ad and tracker blocking tools to protect their privacy. Unfortunately, existing ad and tracker blocking tools are susceptible to mutable advertising and tracking content. In this paper, we first demonstrate that a state-of-the-art ad and tracker blocker, AdGraph, is susceptible to such adversarial evasion techniques that are currently deployed on the web. Second, we introduce WebGraph, the first ML-based ad and tracker blocker that detects ads and trackers based on their action rather than their content. By featurizing the actions that are fundamental to advertising and tracking information flows – e.g., storing an identifier in the browser or sharing an identifier with another tracker – WebGraph performs nearly as well as prior approaches, but is significantly more robust to adversarial evasions. In particular, we show that WebGraph achieves comparable accuracy to AdGraph, while significantly decreasing the success rate of an adversary from near-perfect for AdGraph to around 8% for WebGraph. Finally, we show that WebGraph remains robust to sophisticated adversaries that use adversarial evasion techniques beyond those currently deployed on the web.

Evaluating Methods for Privacy-Preserving Data Sharing in Genomics  
[[Recording](https://youtu.be/gJy0i9KDVrU)]<details>**Abstract:** The availability of genomic data is often essential to progress in biomedical re- search, personalized medicine, drug development, etc. However, its extreme sensitivity makes it problematic, if not outright impossible, to publish or share it. In this dissertation, we study and build systems that are geared towards privacy preserving genomic data sharing. We first look at the Matchmaker Exchange, a platform that connects multiple distributed databases through an API and allows researchers to query for genetic variants in other databases through the network. However, queries are broadcast to all researchers that made a similar query in any of the connected databases, which can lead to a reluctance to use the platform, due to loss of privacy or competitive advantage. In order to overcome this reluctance, we propose a framework to support anonymous querying on the platform.
Since genomic data’s sensitivity does not degrade over time, we analyze the real-world guarantees provided by the only tool available for long term genomic data storage. We find that the system offers low security when the adversary has access to side information, and we support our claims by empirical evidence. We also study the viability of synthetic data for privacy preserving data sharing. Since for genomic data research, the utility of the data provided is of the utmost importance, we first perform a utility evaluation on generative models for different types of datasets (i.e., financial data, images, and locations). Then, we propose a privacy evaluation framework for synthetic data. We then perform a measurement study assessing state-of-the-art generative models specifically geared for human genomic data, looking at both utility and privacy perspectives. Overall, we find that there is no single approach for generating synthetic data that performs well across the board from both utility and privacy perspectives. <br><br>**Bio:** Bristena Oprisanu is a PhD Candidate within the Information Security Research Group at UCL.

Building a private future for the internet with the Nym mixnet  
[[Recording](https://youtu.be/gJy0i9KDVrU)]<details>**Abstract:**Internet was not designed with privacy as a fundamental property at its inception. As a consequence, the lack of privacy exposes billions of people to privacy breaches and mass surveillance. Anonymous communication networks, such as Tor, are vital to maintain our privacy, however, Tor does not defend against powerful adversaries. For message-based systems, it has been shown that mix networks that re-order (mix) packets can defend against these nation-state level adversaries. Nym is building a permissionless and incentivised communication infrastructure, which provides full-stack privacy even against corporations and government actors with the capacity to capture all global internet traffic. In this talk, we outline two core components of the Nym design. We'll start with network-level anonymity, explaining how Nym's decentralized mixnet (which I designed during my PhD at UCL) offers better metadata protection than VPNs, Tor, or peer-to-peer solutions. Next, we will outline Nym's anonymous credentials, which allow the users to prove the right to use applications and services integrated with the Nym network without involving unnecessary user identification and tracking.
<br><br>**Bio**: Ania Piotrowska is a co-founder and Head of Research at Nym Technologies, where she contributes to the R&D of the Nym infrastructure. Her research interests span several aspects of security, privacy-enhancing technologies, distributed systems, and anonymous communication (onion routing, mix networks, p2p). She is also interested in blockchain technologies, particularly in the context of the privacy of cryptocurrencies.

Security and Privacy in the Age of Ubiquitous Computing  
[[Recording](https://youtu.be/THs2yIfBpoA)]<details>**Abstract:** Today, a thermal camera can be bought for < £150 and used to track the heat traces your fingers produced when entering your password on your keyboard. We recently found that thermal imaging can reveal 100% of PINs entered on smartphones up to 30 seconds after they have been entered. Other ubiquitous sensors are continuously becoming more powerful and affordable. They can now be maliciously exploited even by average non-tech-savvy users. The ubiquity of smartphones can itself be a threat to privacy; with personal data being accessible essentially everywhere, sensitive information can easily become subject to prying eyes. There is a significant increase in the number of novel platforms in which users need to perform secure transactions (e.g., payments in VR stores), yet we still use technologies from the 1960s to secure access to them. Mohamed will talk about the implications of these developments and his work in this area with a focus on the challenges, opportunities, and directions for future work.<br><br>**Bio**: Dr Mohamed Khamis is a lecturer at the University of Glasgow's School of Computing Science, where he leads research into Human-centered Security. Mohamed and his team a) investigate how ubiquitous sensors impact privacy, security and safety, and b) design user-centered approaches to overcome these threats.

Isogenies as a foundation of time delay cryptography  
[[Recording](https://youtu.be/LzIH00xn_pg)]<details>>**Abstract:** Time delay cryptography has recently emerged as an alternative to multiparty computation for removing trusted parties from distributed protocols. It is especially attractive in protocols with a large number of participants, as it tends to scale much better than MPC. As an example, Verifiable Delay Functions have only been formalized in 2019, and they are already used or being considered for use in several cryptocurrencies. So far, basically all practical time delay cryptography is based on groups of unknown order, typically RSA groups (with a trusted setup) or ideal class groups of quadratic imaginary number fields. Isogenies of elliptic curves have been used as a foundation for post-quantum cryptography for more than 15 years. In 2019, in a joint work with Masson, Petit and Sanso, we observed that walks in supersingular isogeny graphs could also be used as a foundation for time delay cryptography, although not necessarily in a quantum safe manner. In a recent joint work with Burdges, we introduced a new time delay primitive, named Delay Encryption, and gave the only known instantiation based on the same framework as the isogeny based VDF. In this talk we will review the basic theory of isogenies, explain how they naturally lead to (conjecturally) incompressible sequential computation, and see how they can be combined with pairings to construct time delay primitives. Then, we will discuss the quirks and challenges associated to putting isogeny based delay cryptography into practice. <br><br>**Bio**: Luca De Feo received his PhD from École Polytechnique (France) in 2010, with a thesis on computer algebra and computational number theory.

Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) with Automated Market Maker (AMM) Protocols    
[[Recording](https://youtu.be/vGucsoiPIro)]<details>**Abstract:** As an integral part of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, decentralized exchanges (DEX) with automated market maker (AMM) protocols have gained massive traction with the recently revived interest in blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT) in general. Instead of matching the buy and sell sides, AMMs employ a peer-to-pool method and determine asset price algorithmically through a so-called conservation function. To facilitate the improvement and development of AMM-based DEX, we create the first systematization of knowledge in this area. We first establish a general AMM framework describing the economics and formalizing the system's state-space representation. We then employ our framework to systematically compare the top AMM protocols' mechanics, illustrating their conservation functions, as well as slippage and divergence loss functions. We further discuss security and privacy concerns, how they are enabled by AMM-based DEX's inherent properties, and explore mitigating solutions. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive literature review on related work covering both DeFi and conventional market microstructure. <br><br>**Bio**: Dr. Jiahua Xu is Lecturer in Financial Computing at UCL, where she teaches Blockchain Technologies and Machine Learning in Finance.

Characterizing Abhorrent, Misinformative, and Mistargeted Content on YouTube  
[[Recording](https://youtu.be/P-8M9uWiyKE)]<details>**Abstract:** YouTube has revolutionized the way people discover and consume video content. Although YouTube facilitates easy access to hundreds of well-produced educational, entertaining, and trustworthy news videos, abhorrent, misinformative and mistargeted content is also common. The platform is plagued by various types of inappropriate content including: 1) disturbing videos targeting young children; 2) hateful and misogynistic content; and 3) pseudoscientific and conspiratorial content. While YouTube’s recommendation algorithm plays a vital role in increasing user engagement and YouTube’s monetization, its role in unwittingly promoting problematic content is not entirely understood. In this talk, I will present our results from three cases studies on abhorrent, misinformative, and mistargeted content on YouTube, and I will motivate why it is important to investigate the role of the YouTube’s recommendation algorithm in the discovery and dissemination of such content. Specifically, in these cases studies we devise various methodologies to detect problematic content, and we use them to simulate the behaviour of users casually browsing YouTube to shed light on: 1) the risks of YouTube media consumption by young children; 2) the role of YouTube’s recommendation algorithm in the dissemination of hateful and misogynistic content, by focusing on the Involuntary Celibates (Incels) community; and 3) user exposure to pseudoscientific misinformation on various parts of the platform and how this exposure changes based on the user’s watch history.<br><br>**Bio**: Dr. Kostantinos Papadamou is a Post-doctoral Researcher at University College London working on the PROACTIVE project as part of REPHRAIN.

Sex, Work, and Technology: Lessons for Internet Governance & Digital Safety  
[[Recording](https://youtu.be/qu1YgdySf3Y)]<details>**Abstract:** Sex workers sit at the intersection of multiple marginalized identities and make up a sizable workforce: the UN estimates that at least 42 million sex workers are conducting business across the globe. Sex workers face a unique and significant set of digital, social, political, legal, and safety risks; yet their digital experiences have received little study in the CS and HCI literature. In this talk we will review findings from a 2-year long study examining how sex workers who work in countries where sex work is legal (Germany, Switzerland, the UK) use technology to conduct business and how they have developed digital strategies for staying safe online and offline. We will then describe how these findings can inform broader conversations around internet governance, digital discrimination, and safety protections for other marginalized and vulnerable users whose experiences bisect the digital and physical. <br><br>**Bio**: Dr. Elissa M.

Polynomial Representation Is Tricky: Maliciously Secure Private Set Intersection Revisited  
[[Recording](https://youtu.be/clT3DImqfck)]<details>**Abstract:** Private Set Intersection protocols (PSIs) allow parties to compute the intersection of their private sets, such that nothing about the sets’ elements beyond the intersection is revealed. PSIs have a variety of applications, primarily in efficiently supporting data sharing in a privacy-preserving manner. At Eurocrypt 2019, Ghosh and Nilges proposed three efficient PSIs based on the polynomial representation of sets and proved their security against active adversaries. In this talk, I will discuss that these three PSIs are susceptible to several serious attacks. The attacks let an adversary (1) learn the correct intersection while making its victim believe that the intersection is empty, (2) learn a certain element of its victim’s set beyond the intersection, and (3) delete multiple elements of its victim’s input set. I will explain why the proofs did not identify these attacks and discuss how the issues can be rectified. This is a joint work with Steven Murdoch (UCL) and Thomas Zacharias (University of Edinburgh). <br><br>**Bio**: Aydin Abadi is a research fellow at UCL.

Privacy Is Hard and Seven Other Myths. Achieving Privacy through Careful Design  
[[Recording](https://youtu.be/wUAj7gcx2qI)]<details>**Abstract:** Technological developments have made it easier to invade our privacy. Yet technology can also be used to protect privacy. Privacy by design is a methodology that aims to incorporate privacy in the system development cycle from the very start. Careful design makes it possible to make the services that we use in our daily life much more privacy friendly. In this talk I will show how, using concrete examples, thus debunking several privacy myths, like "we are not collecting personal data", "we always need to know who you are" and "privacy is hard". (This is a talk based on my book with the same title that will appear at MIT Press on October 5). <br><br>**Bio**: Jaap-Henk Hoepman (1966) is associate professor at the Digital Security group of the Radboud University, Nijmegen, the Netherlands, working for the iHub, the interdisciplinary research hub on Security, Privacy, and Data Governance.

How do we draw the line between permissible and impermissible online influence? 
[[Recording]()] <details>**Abstract:** Since the 2016 Russian influence campaign against the United States, scholars have tried to articulate, in precise terms, why the influence campaign was harmful, wrong, and, according to some, illegal. Some scholars have argued that the influence campaign was an infringement of sovereignty. Others have argued that it undermined the right to self-determination. Stronger still, some have suggested that the campaign might constitute an attack. I contend that none of these frameworks are adequate for explaining the particular wrong of foreign influence, nor are they conceptually satisfying in the context of online influence. I argue that to articulate the wrong of certain kinds of influence, we ought to reframe the conversation so that it is not about “foreign influence” but “pernicious influence”. Instead of focusing on the nationality of the actor, we should focus on the specific features of influence we take to be normatively problematic, such as deception and/or the spread of disinformation. The upshots of this account are that it allows us to talk meaningfully about the connection between domestic and foreign influence, and to draw lines between permissible and impermissible influence, broadly construed. <br><br>**Bio**: Beba is a Ph.D candidate in philosophy and Fritz Family Fellow at Georgetown University focusing on applied ethics, social and political philosophy, and social epistemology.

Multi-instance Publicly Verifiable Time-lock Puzzle and its Applications  
[[Recording](https://youtu.be/a-URmUnODe8)]<details>**Abstract:** Time-lock puzzles are elegant protocols that enable a party to lock a message such that no one else can unlock it until a certain time elapses. Nevertheless, existing schemes are not suitable for the case where a server is given multiple instances of a puzzle scheme at once and it must unlock them at different points in time. If the schemes are naively used in this setting, then the server has to start solving all puzzles as soon as it receives them, that ultimately imposes significant computation cost and demands a high level of parallelisation. In this talk, I will discuss a new generic primitive called “multi-instance time-lock puzzle” that tackles the aforementioned issues, by composing a puzzle’s instances. I will also talk about the primitive’s candidate construction called: “chained time-lock puzzle” (C-TLP). It allows the server, given instances’ composition, to solve puzzles sequentially, without having to run parallel computations on them. C-TLP makes black-box use of a standard time-lock puzzle scheme and is accompanied by a lightweight publicly verifiable algorithm. It is the first time-lock puzzle that offers a combination of the above features. Moreover, I will discuss how C-TLP can be used to build the first “outsourced proofs of retrievability” that can support real-time detection and fair payment while having lower overhead than the state of the art. Also, one can substitute a “verifiable delay function” with C-TLP (in certain cases), to gain much better efficiency.<br><br>**Bio**: Aydin Abadi is a research fellow at UCL.

Towards Cognitive Obfuscation - Understanding Cognitive Processes of Hardware Reverse Engineers  
[[Recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPp-65h8lCE)]<details>**Abstract:** Hardware builds the foundation of our modern digital society with its innumerable interconnected electronic devices, and is realized in form of integrated circuits (ICs), i.e., microchips, which often perform various security-critical functions. They are, thus, attractive targets for attacks and malicious manipulations. In our talk, we focus on a specific method to understand the inner structures and functionalities of microchips – hardware reverse engineering (HRE) which is applied for legitimate purposes (e.g., detection of hardware Trojans), and also to illegitimate ends such as intellectual property infringement, or the injection of malicious hardware backdoors. As tools that automate the entire HRE process do not yet exist, hardware reverse engineers are forced to make sense out of semi-automated HRE steps that are driven by human problem-solving processes and cognitive factors. Consequently, the success of HRE strongly depends on the analysts’ cognitive processes. However, the understanding of the underlying cognitive processes and factors in HRE have thus far not gained much attention in the research community, and remain largely unexplored and opaque. In our talk, we will provide an overview of our initial research results from our interdisciplinary research project. We present a study with hardware reverse engineers on different levels of expertise (i.e., intermediate and expert) who were asked to complete a realistic HRE task involving the removal of an intellectual property protection mechanism from an unknown chip design. A qualitative analysis of 2,445 detailed log entries led to the creation of a hierarchical HRE taxonomy consisting of 103 unique open codes and an in-depth analysis of applied problem-solving strategies. We discuss our findings in the light of recent literature on problem solving and expertise, and outline ideas for future research on quantifying our exploratory results and to develop novel countermeasures impeding HRE.<br><br>**Bio**: Carina Wiesen is a research assistant at the Educational Psychology Lab in the Institute of Educational Research at the Ruhr-Universität Bochum (supervised by Prof. Dr. Nikol Rummel and Prof. Dr.-Ing.

Consensus in the Permissionless Setting   
[[Recording](https://youtu.be/ctF5C-ScG7s)]<details>**Abstract:** In the distributed computing literature, consensus protocols have traditionally been studied in a setting where all participants are known to each other from the start of the protocol execution. In the parlance of the ‘blockchain’ literature, this is referred to as the permissioned setting. What differentiates the most prominent blockchain protocol Bitcoin from these previously studied protocols is that it operates in a permissionless setting, i.e. it is a protocol for establishing consensus over an unknown network of participants that anybody can join, with as many identities as they like in any role.  I’ll talk about recent work with Tim Roughgarden in which we describe a formal framework for the analysis of both permissioned and permissionless systems.<br><br>**Bio**: Andrew Lewis-Pye is a Professor in the Department of Mathematics at the London School of Economics.

Cryptocurrency trading at 10: From “Monopoly money” to billion-dollar derivatives markets  
[[Recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1ypsNJezG0)]<details>**Abstract:** In a little more than a decade, modern cryptocurrencies have gone from a marginal product used mostly by hobbyists, to a viable alternative currency for fringe markets, to supporting an entire class of financial assets. In this talk, I will start by looking at the early days of spot markets (fiat for cryptocurrency), outlining some of the inherent risks in that ecosystem. I will then discuss how, since 2018, the cryptocurrency trading landscape has evolved to a hybrid ecosystem featuring complex and popular derivatives products. I will present results based on our study of BitMEX, one of the first derivatives platforms for leveraged cryptocurrency trading. BitMEX trades on average over 3 billion dollars worth of volume per day, and allows users to go long or short Bitcoin with up to 100x leverage. I will discuss how BitMEX products have become the standard across other cryptocurrency derivatives platforms, such as Binance, FTX, or others, which now feature daily trading volumes that, in aggregate, rival those of the New York Stock Exchange. Through an analysis on-chain forensics, public liquidation events, and a site-wide chat room, I will describe the diverse ensemble of amateur and professional traders that forms this community, and how derivative trading has impacted cryptocurrency asset prices, notably how it has led to dramatic price movements in the underlying spot markets.<br><br>**Bio**: Nicolas Christin is an Associate Professor (with tenure) at Carnegie Mellon University, jointly appointed in the School of Computer Science and the Department of Engineering and Public Policy.

Transaction Fee Mechanism Design for the Ethereum Blockchain:<br>An Economic Analysis of EIP-1559  
[[Recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCoht6gh-SU)]<details>**Abstract:** EIP-1559 is a proposal to make several tightly coupled changes to the Ethereum blockchain’s transaction fee mechanism, including the introduction of variable-size blocks and a burned base fee that rises and falls with demand.  This proposal is slated for deployment in the London fork (scheduled for late summer 2021), and will be the biggest economic change made to a major blockchain to date.
In this talk we formalize the problem of designing a transaction fee mechanism, taking into account the many idiosyncrasies of the blockchain setting (ranging from off-chain collusion between miners and users to the ease of money-burning). We then situate the specific mechanism proposed in EIP-1559 in this framework and rigorously interrogate its game-theoretic properties. We also touch on two alternative designs that offer different sets of incentive trade-offs.<br><br>**Bio**: Tim Roughgarden is a Professor of Computer Science at Columbia University.

Studying Jerks on the Web: A Socio-Technical Perspective  
[[Recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wdT80kD2K0)]<details>**Abstract:** Over the past two decades, the world has seen an explosion of data. While in the past controlled experiments, surveys, or compilation of high-level statistics allowed us to gain insights into the problems we explored, the Web has brought about a host of new challenges for researchers hoping to gain an understanding of modern socio-technical behavior. First, even discovering appropriate data sources is not a straight forward task. Next, although the Web enables us to collect highly detailed digital information, there are issues of availability and ephemerality: simply put, researchers have no control over what data a 3rd party platform collects and exposes, and more specifically, no control over how long that data will remain available. Third, the massive scale and multiple formats data are available in requires creative execution of analysis. Finally, modern socio-technical problems, while related to typical social problems, are fundamentally different, and in addition to posing a research challenge, can also cause disruption in researchers' personal lives. In this talk, I will discuss how our work has overcome the above challenges. Using concrete examples from our research, I will delve into some of the unique datasets and analyses we have performed, focusing on emerging issues like hate speech, coordinate harassment campaigns, and deplatforming as well as modeling the influence that Web communities have on the spread of disinformation, weaponized memes, etc. Finally, I will discuss how we can design proactive systems to anticipate and predict online abuse and, if time permits, how the "fringe" information ecosystem exposes researchers to attacks by the very actors they study.<br><br>**Bio**: Emiliano De Cristofaro is a Professor at UCL (UCL), where he heads the Information Security Research Group, a Faculty Fellow at the Alan Turing Institute, and a co-founder of the iDramaLab.
